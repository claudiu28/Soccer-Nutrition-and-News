                        1.High Demand for Protein and Recovery Products: The sports nutrition market continues to be driven by a high demand for protein supplements, particularly among performance athletes. Gen Z are the most frequent users of protein shakes and bars, focusing on recovery and muscle growth. Plant-based proteins, such as pea and soy, are growing in popularity due to environmental and dietary concerns.

                        2.AI in Sports Nutrition: AI is playing a bigger role in personalizing nutrition. Companies are using AI to create tailored nutrition plans based on individual genetics and lifestyle.

                        Plant-Based Diets: Plant-based eating is continuing to grow in popularity due to its health
                        benefits and positive environmental impact. More consumers are adopting egalitarian or vegan
                        diets, and studies show potential benefits such as reduced LDL cholesterol and weight loss.
                        However, those transitioning to a plant-based diet should ensure theyâ€™re getting essential
                        nutrients like vitamin B12, iron, and omega-3s.

                        Gut Health and the Gut-Brain Axis: Research is increasingly focused on the connection between
                        gut health and brain function. The gut-brain axis, where gut bacteria influence mood by
                        producing neurotransmitters like serotonin, is an area of interest.
                        Consuming probiotic fiber from foods like bananas, garlic, and oats helps support healthy gut bacteria.

                        Drinks that offer more than just basic nutrition, such as probiotic-infused drinks and electrolyte solutions, are trending.
                        These beverages claim to boost energy, mental focus, and gut health.
                        However, it is essential to monitor the sugar content in these drinks to avoid unwanted calories.
