                Nutrition and sports performance are deeply interconnected, with proper nutrition playing a critical
                role in optimizing athletic ability and recovery. Athletes require a balanced diet rich in
                macronutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats to fuel their bodies and support muscle repair.
                Carbohydrates are vital for providing the energy needed for high-intensity sports, while protein aids in
                muscle recovery and growth post-exercise. Healthy fats contribute to joint health and long-term energy,
                making them equally important. In addition, micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals help support
                immune function, reduce inflammation, and prevent fatigue during rigorous training sessions. Hydration
                is also crucial, as even mild dehydration can impair physical performance. Electrolytes are especially
                important during extended activity, helping to prevent cramps and maintain endurance. Consuming a
                nutrient-dense, well-timed meal before and after workouts ensures that athletes can train harder,
                recover faster, and maintain peak performance. Whether you are a casual runner or a professional
                athlete, nutrition is the foundation of athletic success, supporting endurance, strength, mental focus,
                and overall well-being.
